            <div class="twentytwenty-mission-trip-info">
                <p>The main purpose of Mission Trip Bolivia was to show the Bolivian people Jesus.
                     During our time at Famila Feliz, we poured ourselves into many different types of service. 
                     Our mission team held multiple medical and dental clinics, worked on a new construction
                      project, organized a vacation Bible school for the local children, and put on a week
                       of prayer for the kids living at Familia Feliz. Through these various events,
                        we were able to connect with the hurting people in Rurrenabaque
                     and form precious friendships that we pray will last for all of eternity. </p>

                     <p>Both the medical and dental teams were faced with a busy schedule. 
                         During the first week of our clinics, we spent much time traversing 
                         the countryside and treating a variety of health issues. We traveled 
                         from school to school holding clinics for children and parents in the 
                         local area. The second week was spent treating people in the local 
                         hospital. It was here that the teams were able to create a more organized
                          workflow, efficiently getting people through to see the doctors. 
                          Our triage allowed our team to treat more patients in the same small 
                          timeframe. In all, many of the locals 
                         caught a glimpse of Christ’s love through the efforts 
                         of our medical and dental teams. </p>

                         <p>During our second week of service, we had the privilege 
                             of leading out in week of prayer and VBS on the campus of 
                             Familia Feliz. Week of prayer took place in the mornings for the older 
                             children, and VBS was held in the evenings for the younger ones.
                              The overarching theme woven through these two events was 
                              the loving character of God. Many were touched by these
                               messages, and received 
                             a fuller understanding of what an intimate relationship 
                             with God looks like. </p>

                            <p>The two weeks we spent in the mission field were incredible. 
                                It was during our time serving in the Bolivian jungle that 
                                we were able to see a true demonstration of God’s love and power. 
                                We experienced countless blessings, and learned innumerable lesson 
                                from the hearts of grateful people. We witnessed God’s hand in 
                                acting, saving, and providing for our needs. 
                                We realized that it is indeed more of a blessing 
                                to give rather than receive.</p>
